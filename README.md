# bash-alias
Set of useful bash alias
Copy this file's content and paste it in your bash profile file. The file can be opened using
    `open ~/.bash_profile`
or
    `open ~/.zprofile`
or any other similar file name.

Once you update one of these files, restart the terminal to make these changes in effect.
In the terminal hit `c` enter to see if the terminal is cleared or it. If it is cleared, you successfully completed, else you might have to update some other profile file.
